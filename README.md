# Hiragana-Katakana-Randomizer
This script was written to make practicing Hiragana and Katakana easier since I have not found many tools that will randomize romaji and show you the equivalent hiragana/katakana for practice.

### How to use
- Before using, assure that you have python3 installed, this can be checked running `python3 --version`, if you don't see a python version google how to install it.
- To start, run the command `python3 hiraganaKatakana.py` in the same director as the file
- Select the Lessons that you would like to study by typing either `y` or `n` after the program prompts you
- Finally, you can use the *return* key to cycle through (look at the Romaji, practice writing the Hiragana and Katakana, press enter to see the answer, press enter continue)
